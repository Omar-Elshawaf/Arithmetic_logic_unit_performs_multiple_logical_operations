# Arithmetic_logic_unit_performs_multiple_logical_operations
CSE111 Logic Design course Major Task Phase 1
I am designing and implementing my own ALU that will take 2 numbers (A, B) as inputs (4-bits each) and will
output the result on 7-segment display. The user will be able to select which function to perform. I have
done the following operations:
1- Addition
2- Subtraction
3- Multiplication
4- AND
5- OR
6- Complement A
7- Increment A
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First to be implemented is
1- Addition
2- Subtraction
which will be one circuit only with a control if user input is zero the addition operation works, if input equal to one,  subtraction operation will work.
